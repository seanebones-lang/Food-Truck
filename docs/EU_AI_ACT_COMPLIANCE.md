# EU AI Act Compliance Documentation
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** January 2026  
**Status:** Compliance Ready

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the Food Truck Management System's compliance with the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) 2025. The system has been assessed and documented to ensure compliance with applicable requirements.

---

## AI Act Overview

The EU AI Act regulates artificial intelligence systems in the European Union. It classifies AI systems by risk level and imposes requirements based on that classification.

---

## System Classification

### AI System Assessment

**Question:** Does the Food Truck Management System use AI?

**Answer:** **NO** - The system does not use artificial intelligence, machine learning, or automated decision-making systems.

**System Components:**
- Business logic (rule-based)
- Database queries (SQL)
- Real-time updates (WebSocket)
- Analytics (aggregated data)
- No ML models
- No automated decision-making
- No AI-powered recommendations
- No predictive analytics

### Risk Classification

**Classification:** **NOT APPLICABLE**

Since the system does not use AI, it is not subject to the EU AI Act requirements. However, this document provides a compliance framework should AI features be added in the future.

---

## Compliance Framework (Future-Proofing)

### If AI Features Are Added

Should the system add AI features in the future, the following framework applies:

#### 1. Risk Assessment

**High-Risk AI Systems:**
- Biometric identification
- Critical infrastructure management
- Educational/vocational training
- Employment/worker management
- Access to essential services
- Law enforcement
- Migration/refugee management
- Administration of justice

**Limited Risk AI Systems:**
- Chatbots
- Deepfakes
- Emotion recognition
- Biometric categorization

**Minimal Risk AI Systems:**
- Recommendation systems
- Personalization
- Content filtering

#### 2. Compliance Requirements (If Applicable)

**For High-Risk AI Systems:**
- Risk management system
- Data governance
- Technical documentation
- Record-keeping
- Transparency and user information
- Human oversight
- Accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity
- Quality management system
- Conformity assessment
- Registration in EU database

**For Limited Risk AI Systems:**
- Transparency obligations
- User notification
- Opt-out mechanisms

**For Minimal Risk AI Systems:**
- Voluntary code of conduct
- Best practices

---

## Conclusion

**Current Status:** ✅ **COMPLIANT** - System does not use AI, therefore not subject to EU AI Act requirements.

**Future Considerations:**
- If AI features are added, compliance framework is ready
- Risk assessment required before AI implementation
- Appropriate compliance measures will be implemented based on risk classification

**Recommendation:**
- Continue monitoring EU AI Act developments
- Review compliance status if AI features are added
- Maintain compliance framework for future use
